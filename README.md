This is a weather App which user openWeather API to fetch the real time weather condition of any city
I used HTML CSS and JavaScript with openweather api to make this application 
You can Enter any valid city name accross the Globe to get its Temperature , wind Speed and Humidity in real time

Accuracy depends on Openweather API
